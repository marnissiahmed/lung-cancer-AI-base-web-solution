# Lung Cancer Diagnostic Web Application

![Lung Cancer Diagnostic](frontend/lungdiagnostic/src/assets/Lungcare.png)

## Introduction

The Lung Cancer Diagnostic Web Application is a platform for early detection of lung cancer using deep learning techniques. It provides users with a convenient way to upload lung images and receive diagnostic results based on deep learning algorithms.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register new accounts or log in with existing ones to access the application.
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload lung images for analysis.
- **Diagnostic Results:** Users can view diagnostic results generated by deep learning algorithms.
- **Dashboard:** Provides a dashboard for visualization of diagnostic trends and statistics.
- **Admin Panel:** Administrators can manage users and diagnostic data through the admin panel.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Django: Python-based web framework for backend development
  - MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing diagnostic data
  - Deep Lab: Deep learning model for lung cancer diagnosis
  
- **Frontend:**
  - Angular: Frontend framework for building dynamic web applications
